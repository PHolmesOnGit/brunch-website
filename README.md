# brunch-website
A simple web app that allows users to create accounts, post recipes, and view others recipes. Built on Python, Flask, and Sqlite

Built in a large part by following the flask 3.0 blog tutorial https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/tutorial/ 
would highly recommend if you are wanting to learn more about flask. 
I then took the blog and edited/added to it to fit what I wanted for the website.
